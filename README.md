SmartKnower Machine Learning Internship's **Major Project**

ðŸš€ The website is live on Heroku [**Sentiment-Analysis**](https://sentiment-analysis-ml-major.herokuapp.com/) <br>
This is my [Machine Learning - Major Project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TysED8609mKTLsVENhYhB9aVHhR5td7Q?usp=sharing), I have worked on **SKLEARN Logistic Regression** library to do sentiment analysis on Amazon Review dataset.

I have used **Count Vectorizer** to convert string into number array.

Algorithm:
* SKLEARN - Logistic Regression

Accuracy: **93%**

**Description**
----
I have created model using **Logistic Regression** with an accuracy of **93%** and saved the model using **Pickle** for later use. <br>
The Pickle saved model is used for **Streamlit** & **Ngrok** hostings.

Since Pickle model is suit well with Heroku, another model created with **Joblib** for heroku hosting.
